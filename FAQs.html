                        <p>Yes. Every policy comes with a validity of 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years, after which it needs to be renewed. The insurance companies provide you a grace period of 15 days from the date of expiry during which you can pay the premium
                            and continue availing of policy benefits. If the premium is not paid even during the grace period, then the policy will lapse, and you will lose the accumulated benefits such as waiting for period benefits or No Claim Bonus
                            and will have to buy a new policy to seek protection from healthcare expenses.</p>
